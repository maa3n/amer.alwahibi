      International art is a lake in which all cultures flow. There is no universal art that depends only on localism. I work from my place and through my unparalleled time.
      In any museum what you find is a painting, so it is considered an international art and yet it is local art whether it is Asian or African art or Latin American or European art.
      It is assumed that the painting does not enter the world, but rather is the saying of globalism, which is international fame, and I am a local matter. That is why we know that African art has its own identity, and Asian art has its own idea and is on the minds of everyone who receives this vision. So art is not purely universal and it is not a medal on the chest of the other at all, but it is completely local art. We also see African art wearing African masks wherever you go see this art exists and has its identity, so I am with the identity in general and not with the global. If there is an identity for international art even for literature and music in everything there is local art. It is universality that takes this trait in order to place it in a noble way, because they are the owners of the their lands.
      Abstraction does not come from nothing, but nothing comes from abstraction.
Nothing means “ a gap in the memory”
By: Amer Alwahibi



For me abstract and reality are two poles of one magnetic poles.
If i will cut a bar magnet in half then each half becomes its own bar magnet with two poles which are abstract and reality. Even i did so i will get them closer to each other, but never gathering.
I think all the art movements are situated between these two poles.
I mean this an example to explain more about my art position right now and before.

I think every artist has made her/his own handmade mirror that reflects the society, environment, surrounding and culture where they live at the moment. This mirror has two attributes which is able to fold and look through it as well.  

I mean when you look at a mirror. How far you stand from it, how you could see more of the scene.
When you look through a window. How close you stand from it, how you could see more of the scene.
